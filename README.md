I implemented this code in AR Drone 2.0 using the robot platform (ROS: Robot Operating System).

--To run the code, make sure your code become node--

Make Workspace of your code (http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage) - go to your simulator directory, cd ~/"yourdirectory_workspace"/src - catkin_create_pkg (nama package) std_msgs rospy roscpp - cd .. - catkin_make - source devel/setup.bash - rospack depends (nama package)
Coding your python/C++ program
Make your code bocome node python
cd ~/"yourdirectory_workspace"/src/"your directory"
chmod +x (file name)
to make sure your code is node $ls and if your code colour is green, run code
open new command line
cd ~/"yourdirectory_workspace"/
source devel/setup.bash
rosrun script (file name)
